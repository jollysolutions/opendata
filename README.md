========

Latest &amp; first public version of my code that monitors the UK Rail Network in real time using Open Data feeds.

The output of the various applications provided here are used to generate independent performance statistics.

By their request various Rail User Groups (RUGs) in the South East of England use these statistics for various campaigns.

At the moment this is alpha code but it's intended to replace the aging system I'm currently using to update the
http://uktra.in website.

Requirements
============
* Java 8
* RabbitMQ 3.3.1 or later

Notes
=====

Although this project is currently primarily concerned with Rail Open Data,
it's actually for any Open Data feeds. Once I have completed transfering
all of the rail system over to this project I'll be migrating other feeds
like the MetOffice Data Point which I also use.
